Weather Integration: Fetch real-time weather data for the destination using OpenWeatherMap API.
Local Cuisine & Restaurants: Suggest famous local foods and restaurants based on budget (Economy, Standard, Luxury) using Spoonacular API.
Landmarks & Attractions: Recommend iconic landmarks and attractions tailored to user interests using Geoapify API.
City Information: Provide a brief description and image of the destination via Wikipedia API.
Interactive Frontend: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface to input preferences and view itineraries.
Predefined City Database: Includes popular cities (e.g., Paris, New York, Tokyo, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) with famous landmarks and foods.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
Frontend: Streamlit
APIs:
OpenWeatherMap (Weather)
Spoonacular (Restaurants)
Geoapify (Places/Attractions)
Wikipedia (City Information)
Dependencies: Requests, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Environment: Python 3.12.4, Jupyter Notebook

Installation
1.Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-travel-itinerary-planner

2.Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3.Install Dependencies
pip install flask flask_cors requests streamlit

4.Obtain API Keys:
Sign up for API keys from:
OpenWeatherMap
Spoonacular
Geoapify

Replace the placeholder API keys in travel_itinerary1.py with your own:
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_api_key"
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY = "your_spoonacular_api_key"
GEOAPIFY_API_KEY = "your_geoapify_api_key"

Usage
1.Run the Backend (Flask Server):
python travel_itinerary1.py

2.The Flask server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Run the Frontend (Streamlit): Open a new terminal, activate the virtual environment, and run
streamlit run travel_frontend.py

3.Interact with the App:
Enter a destination or select from popular cities (e.g., Paris, Delhi, Tokyo).
Choose trip duration, start date, budget, and interests.
Click "Generate Itinerary" to view a detailed plan with daily activities, weather, local foods, landmarks, restaurants, and attractions

API Keys
The application relies on the following APIs. Ensure you have valid keys and update them in travel_itinerary1.py:

OpenWeatherMap: For weather data.
Spoonacular: For restaurant recommendations.
Geoapify: For attractions and places of interest.
Wikipedia: No API key required for basic summary and image retrieval.
Note: The provided API keys in the notebook are placeholders and may not work. Obtain your own keys to avoid rate limits or errors
